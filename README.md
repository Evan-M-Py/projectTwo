TALES FROM THE PIT!
------
Have you ever loved a band and seen them live and instantly lost respect for them because the lead singer couldn't actually sing, or the drummer couldn't keep a beat?

Have you ever been dragged by your friends to a show for a band you've never heard of, and then left the concert as a new fan?

Have you ever seen an artist heckle the audience?

Have you ever discovered that the singer with the "amazing voice" actually just lipsyncs?

Shouldn't there be a place to share all these experiences?

Welcome to Tales from the Pit, where you can rate and comment on the performaces of some of the industrys biggest artists and share your experience seeing them live!
